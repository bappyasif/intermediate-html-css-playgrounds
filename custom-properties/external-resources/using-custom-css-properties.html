        Inheritance of custom properties

        >> Custom properties do inherit
        >> This means that if no value is set for a custom property on a given element, the value of its parent is used
        >> consider this following scenario: 
            <div class="one">
                <div class="two">
                    <div class="three"></div>
                    <div class="four"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            >> with this following css:
                .two {
                --test: 10px;
                }

                .three {
                --test: 2em;
                }
            >> results of var(--test) are: 
                >> for class="two" element: 10px
                >> for class="three" element: 2em
                >> for class="four" element: 10px (inherited from its parent)
                >> for class="one" element: invalid value, which is the default value of any custom property
        >> custom properties are computed where it is needed, not stored for use in other rules
            >> For instance, you cannot set a property for an element and expect to retrieve it in a sibling's descendant's rule
            >> property is only set for the matching selector and its descendants, like any normal CSS

    
        Custom property fallback values
        >> Using the var() function, you can define multiple fallback values when the given variable is not yet defined
        >> this can be useful when working with Custom Elements and Shadow DOM
        >> Fallback values aren't used to fix the browser compatibility
        >> If the browser doesn't support CSS custom properties, the fallback value won't help
        >> It's just a backup for the browser which supports CSS custom properties to choose a different value if the given variable isn't defined or has an invalid value
        >> first argument to the function is the name of the custom property to be substituted
        >> second argument to the function, if provided, is a fallback value, which is used as the substitution value when the referenced custom property is invalid
        >> If that second parameter is invalid, such as if a comma-separated list is provided, the fallback will fail
        >> consider this: 
            .two {
            /* Red if --my-var is not defined */
            color: var(--my-var, red);
            }

            .three {
            /* pink if --my-var and --my-background are not defined */
            background-color: var(--my-var, var(--my-background, pink));
            }

            .three {
            /* Invalid: "--my-background, pink" */
            background-color: var(--my-var, --my-background, pink);
            }

            >> Including a custom property as a fallback, as seen in the second example above, is the correct way to provide more than one fallback
            >> such technique has been seen to cause performance issues as it takes more time to parse through the variables
            >> syntax of the fallback, like that of custom properties, allows commas: 
                >> For example, var(--foo, red, blue) defines a fallback of red, blue â€” anything between the first comma and the end of the function is considered a fallback value
    
            
        Handling invalid custom properties
        >> Each CSS property can be assigned a defined set of values
        >> If you try to assign a value to a property that is outside its set of valid values, it's considered invalid
        >> When the browser encounters an invalid value for a normal property, it discards the value, and elements are assigned the values that they would have had if the declaration simply did not exist
        >> However, when the values of custom properties are parsed, the browser doesn't yet know where they will be used, so it must consider nearly all values as valid
        >> When the browser encounters an invalid var() substitution, then the initial or inherited value of the property is used
        >> Properties and custom variables can lead to invalid CSS statements, leading to the new concept of valid at computed time

         Invalid normal properties

         >> In this example we attempt to apply a value of 16px to the color property
         >> Because this is invalid, the CSS is discarded and the result is as if the rule did not exist, so the previous color: blue rule is applied instead, and the paragraph is blue

    <!-- 
        Invalid custom properties

        >> This example is just like the last one, except we use a custom property
        >> As expected, the browser substitutes the value of --text-color in place of var(--text-color), but 16px is not a valid property value for color
        >> After substitution, the property doesn't make sense
        >> browser handles this situation in two steps:
            >> Check if the property color is inheritable
            >> It is, but this <p> doesn't have any parent with the color property set, s we move onto next step
            >> Set the value to its default initial value, which is black

    <div class="invalid-custom">
        <style>

                --text-color: 16px;

        Values in JavaScript

        >> To use the values of custom properties in JavaScript, it is just like standard properties

        // get variable from wherever
        getComputedStyle(element).getPropertyValue("--my-var");

        article how browsers work: some excerpt

        sharing style data:
        >> elements must be in the same mouse state (e.g., one can't be in :hover while the other isn't)
        >> Neither element should have an id
        >> tag names should match
        >> class attributes should match
        >> set of mapped attributes must be identical
        >> link states must match
        >> focus states must match
        >> Neither element should be affected by attribute selectors, where affected is defined as having any selector match that uses an attribute selector in any position within the selector at all
        >> There must be no inline style attribute on the elements
        >> There must be no sibling selectors in use at all
            >> WebCore simply throws a global switch when any sibling selector is encountered and disables style sharing for the entire document when they are present
            >> This includes the + selector and selectors like :first-child and :last-child
        
        Style sheet cascade order
        >> Browser declarations
        >> User normal declarations
        >> Author normal declarations
        >> Author important declarations
        >> User important declarations

        >> browser declarations are least important and the user overrides the author only if the declaration was marked as important
        >> Declarations with the same order will be sorted by specificity and then the order they are specified


        Selector speceficity:
        >> count 1 if the declaration it is from is a 'style' attribute rather than a rule with a selector, 0 otherwise (= a)
        >> count the number of ID attributes in the selector (= b)
        >> count the number of other attributes and pseudo-classes in the selector (= c)
        >> count the number of element names and pseudo-elements in the selector (= d)
        
        layout process: ususlaly has following pattern: 
        >> Parent renderer determines its own width
        >> Parent goes over children and: 
            >> Place the child renderer (sets its x and y)
            >> Calls child layout if neededâ€“they are dirty or we are in a global layout, or for some other reasonâ€“which calculates the child's height
        >> Parent uses children's accumulative heights and the heights of margins and padding to set its own heightâ€“this will be used by the parent renderer's parent
        >> Sets its dirty bit to false

        Width calculation: 
        >> renderer's width is calculated using the container block's width, the renderer's style "width" property, the margins and borders
            >> container width is the maximum of the containers availableWidth and 0
            >> availableWidth in this case is the contentWidth which is calculated as: clientWidth() - paddingLeft() - paddingRight()
            >> clientWidth and clientHeight represent the interior of an object excluding border and scrollbar
            >> elements width is the "width" style attribute
                >> It will be calculated as an absolute value by computing the percentage of the container width
            >> horizontal borders and paddings are now added
            >> So far this was the calculation of the "preferred width". Now the minimum and maximum widths will be calculated
            >> If the preferred width is greater then the maximum width, the maximum width is used
            >> If it is less then the minimum width (the smallest unbreakable unit) then the minimum width is used
            >> values are cached in case a layout is needed, but the width does not change

        Painting order: 
        >> This is actually the order in which the elements are stacked in the stacking contexts
        >> This order affects painting since the stacks are painted from back to front
        >> stacking order of a block renderer is: 
            >> background color
            >> background image
            >> border
            >> children
            >> outline
        
        Dynamic changes: 
        >> browsers try to do the minimal possible actions in response to a change
            >> changes to an element's color will cause only repaint of the element
            >> Changes to the element position will cause layout and repaint of the element, its children and possibly siblings
            >> Adding a DOM node will cause layout and repaint of the node
            >> Major changes, like increasing font size of the "html" element, will cause invalidation of caches, relayout and repaint of the entire tree

        Positioning scheme: 
        >> There are three schemes:
            >> Normal: 
                >> object is positioned according to its place in the document
                >> This means its place in the render tree is like its place in the DOM tree and laid out according to its box type and dimensions
            >> Float: 
                >> object is first laid out like normal flow, then moved as far left or right as possible
            >> Absolute: 
                >> object is put in the render tree in a different place than in the DOM tree
        >> positioning scheme is set by the "position" property and the "float" attribute
        >> static and relative cause a normal flow
        >> absolute and fixed cause absolute positioning
        >> In static positioning no position is defined and the default positioning is used
        >> In the other schemes, the author specifies the position: top, bottom, left, right
        >> way the box is laid out is determined by: 
            >> Box type
            >> Box dimensions
            >> Positioning scheme
            >> External information such as image size and the size of the screen
        
        Box types: 
        >> block box: 
            >> forms a blockâ€“has its own rectangle in the browser window
        >> inline box: 
            >> does not have its own block, but is inside a containing block
        >> Blocks are formatted vertically one after the other
        >> Inlines are formatted horizontally
            >> If the container width is not enough, the inlines will be put on several lines
        
        Layered representation: 
        >> This is specified by the z-index CSS property
        >> It represents the third dimension of the box: its position along the "z axis"
        >> boxes are divided into stacks (called stacking contexts)
        >> In each stack the back elements will be painted first and the forward elements on top, closer to the user
        >> In case of overlap the foremost element will hide the former element
        >> stacks are ordered according to the z-index property
        >> Boxes with "z-index" property form a local stack
        >> viewport has outer stack
        >> if z-index property is higher, so it is more forward in the stack held by the root box
