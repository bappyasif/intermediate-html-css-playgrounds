    <!-- What are SVGs? -->
    <!-- SVGs are a scalable image format, which means they will easily scale to any size and retain their quality without increasing their filesize -->
    <!-- They’re also very useful if you need to create or modify your images programmatically, because you can change their properties through CSS and JavaScript -->
    <!-- “SVG” stands for “Scalable Vector Graphic.” Vector graphics are simply images defined by math, as opposed to traditional “raster graphics,” where your image is defined by a grid of pixels -->
    <!-- they can scale to any size you want, and it will have no effect on the quality or the size of the file -->
    <!-- SVGs have another interesting aspect to them: they’re defined using XML. XML (aka, “Extensible Markup Language”) is an HTML-like syntax which is used for lots of things, from APIs, to RSS, to spreadsheet and word editor software -->
    <!-- 
        The fact that SVG source-code is XML has a few key benefits: 
            > it means that it is human-readable
            > it’s designed to be interoperable with HTML, which means you can put the above code directly in an HTML file, without any changes, and it should display the image
            > And because these can become elements in the DOM just like HTML elements, you can target them with CSS and create them using the Element WebAPI
     -->

    <!-- 
         Drawbacks: 
         > SVGs are great for relatively simple images, but because every single detail of the image needs to be written out as XML, they are extremely inefficient at storing complex images
         > If your image is supposed to be photo-realistic, or it has fine detail or texture (“grunge textures” are a great example), then SVGs are the wrong tool for the job
    -->

    <!-- Anatomy of an SVG -->
    <!-- Typically, you will not want to create SVGs from scratch in your code -->
    <!-- Most often you will download the file or copy the code either from a website, or from an image editor that can create them (Adobe Illustrator and Figma are two popular apps that can create SVGs) -->
    <!-- However, it’s pretty common to download an SVG and want to tweak or adjust it just a little bit, so knowing what all the bits and pieces are, and how they work is very useful -->
    <!-- 
        >> xmlns: stands for “XML NameSpace"
            > This specifies what dialect of XML you’re using–in our case, that dialect is the SVG language spec. Without it, some browsers will not render your image or will render it incorrectly
        >> viewbox: defines the bounds of your SVG
            > When you have to define the positions of different points of the elements in your SVG, this is what that’s referencing
            > It also defines the aspect ratio and the origin of your SVG
        >> class, id: these attributes function just like they do in HTML
            > Using these in SVGs allows you to easily target an element via CSS or JavaScript, or to reuse an element via the use elements
        >> <circle>, <rect>, <path>, and <text>: are defined by the SVG namespace
            > These are our basic building-blocks
        >> Many SVG attributes, such as fill and stroke, can be changed in your CSS

        Embedding SVGs: 

        >> There are two main approaches when deciding how to actually place the SVG in your document: linked, and inline

        >> Linking SVGs works basically the same way as linking any other image

        >> You can use an HTML image element such as <img>, or link it in your CSS using background-image: url(./my-image.svg), The alternative is to inline your SVGs by pasting their contents directly into your webpage’s code, rather than linking to it as an image

        >> The alternative is to inline your SVGs by pasting their contents directly into your webpage’s code, rather than linking to it as an image, It will still render correctly, but the SVG’s properties will be visible to your code, which will allow you to alter the image dynamically via CSS or JavaScript

        >> Inlining SVGs allows you to unlock their full potential, but it also comes with some serious drawbacks: it makes your code harder to read, makes your page less cacheable, and if it’s a large SVG it might delay the rest of your HTML from loading
