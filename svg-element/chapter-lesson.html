    <!-- What are SVGs? -->
    <!-- SVGs are a scalable image format, which means they will easily scale to any size and retain their quality without increasing their filesize -->
    <!-- They’re also very useful if you need to create or modify your images programmatically, because you can change their properties through CSS and JavaScript -->
    <!-- “SVG” stands for “Scalable Vector Graphic.” Vector graphics are simply images defined by math, as opposed to traditional “raster graphics,” where your image is defined by a grid of pixels -->
    <!-- they can scale to any size you want, and it will have no effect on the quality or the size of the file -->
    <!-- SVGs have another interesting aspect to them: they’re defined using XML. XML (aka, “Extensible Markup Language”) is an HTML-like syntax which is used for lots of things, from APIs, to RSS, to spreadsheet and word editor software -->
    <!-- 
        The fact that SVG source-code is XML has a few key benefits: 
            > it means that it is human-readable
            > it’s designed to be interoperable with HTML, which means you can put the above code directly in an HTML file, without any changes, and it should display the image
            > And because these can become elements in the DOM just like HTML elements, you can target them with CSS and create them using the Element WebAPI
     -->

    <!-- 
         Drawbacks: 
         > SVGs are great for relatively simple images, but because every single detail of the image needs to be written out as XML, they are extremely inefficient at storing complex images
         > If your image is supposed to be photo-realistic, or it has fine detail or texture (“grunge textures” are a great example), then SVGs are the wrong tool for the job
    -->

    <!-- Anatomy of an SVG -->
    <!-- Typically, you will not want to create SVGs from scratch in your code -->
    <!-- Most often you will download the file or copy the code either from a website, or from an image editor that can create them (Adobe Illustrator and Figma are two popular apps that can create SVGs) -->
    <!-- However, it’s pretty common to download an SVG and want to tweak or adjust it just a little bit, so knowing what all the bits and pieces are, and how they work is very useful -->
    <!-- 
        >> xmlns: stands for “XML NameSpace"
            > This specifies what dialect of XML you’re using–in our case, that dialect is the SVG language spec. Without it, some browsers will not render your image or will render it incorrectly
        >> viewbox: defines the bounds of your SVG
            > When you have to define the positions of different points of the elements in your SVG, this is what that’s referencing
            > It also defines the aspect ratio and the origin of your SVG
        >> class, id: these attributes function just like they do in HTML
            > Using these in SVGs allows you to easily target an element via CSS or JavaScript, or to reuse an element via the use elements
        >> <circle>, <rect>, <path>, and <text>: are defined by the SVG namespace
            > These are our basic building-blocks
        >> Many SVG attributes, such as fill and stroke, can be changed in your CSS

        Embedding SVGs: 

        >> There are two main approaches when deciding how to actually place the SVG in your document: linked, and inline

        >> Linking SVGs works basically the same way as linking any other image

        >> You can use an HTML image element such as <img>, or link it in your CSS using background-image: url(./my-image.svg), The alternative is to inline your SVGs by pasting their contents directly into your webpage’s code, rather than linking to it as an image

        >> The alternative is to inline your SVGs by pasting their contents directly into your webpage’s code, rather than linking to it as an image, It will still render correctly, but the SVG’s properties will be visible to your code, which will allow you to alter the image dynamically via CSS or JavaScript

        >> Inlining SVGs allows you to unlock their full potential, but it also comes with some serious drawbacks: it makes your code harder to read, makes your page less cacheable, and if it’s a large SVG it might delay the rest of your HTML from loading
    -->

    <!-- 
        XML namespace: 

        Declaring namespaces:
            > The namespace declaration is provided by the xmlns parameter
            > This parameter says that the <svg> element and its child elements belong to whichever XML dialect has the namespace name (e.g. http://www.w3.org/2000/svg) which is, of course, SVG
            > The declaration defines the default namespace, so the user agent knows that all the <svg> element's descendants also belong to the same namespace
            > Note that namespace names are just strings, so the fact that the SVG namespace name also looks like a URI isn't important
            > URIs are commonly used because they are unique, the intention is not to "link" somewhere. (In fact URIs are used so frequently that the term "namespace URI" is commonly used instead of "namespace name".)

        Redeclaring the default namespace:
            > In this example the xmlns parameter on the root <html> element declares the default namespace to be XHTML
            > As a result, it and all its child elements are interpreted by the user agent as belonging to XHTML, except for the <svg> element
            > The <svg> element has its own xmlns parameter, and by redeclaring the default namespace, this tells the user agent that the <svg> element and its descendants (unless they also redeclare the default namespace) belong to SVG
                
            <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <body>
                <-- some XHTML tags here ->
                <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="300px" height="200px">
                    <-- some SVG tags here ->
                </svg>
                <-- some XHTML tags here ->
                </body>
            </html>
        
        Declaring namespace prefixes: XML dialects not only define their own elements, but also their own parameters:
            > By default, parameters don't have a namespace at all
            > However, sometimes it is necessary to define parameters so that they can be reused on many different elements and still be considered to be the same parameter, independently of the element with which they are used
            > A very good example of this is the href parameter defined by the XLink specification, This parameter is commonly used by other XML dialects as a means to link to external resources
            > int his example, instead of setting the default namespace, this namespace declaration sets the namespace for something called a "namespace prefix"
            > In this case, we have chosen to use the prefix xlink (the second part) since the prefix will be used to tell the user agent about attributes that belong to XLink
            > Note that it is an XML error to use a prefix that hasn't been bound to a namespace name
            > The binding created by the xmlns:xlink parameter in the example above is absolutely essential for the xlink:href parameter to not cause an error
            > This XLink parameter is also frequently used in SVG on the <a>, <use> and <image> elements among others, so it's a good idea to always include the XLink declaration in your documents
            
            <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
                xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
                <script xlink:href="cool-script.js" type="text/ecmascript"/>
            </svg>
    -->
    
    <!-- As an aside, it's useful to know that namespace prefixes can also be used for element names -->
    <!-- This tells the user agent that the particular element (but not its children this time!) belongs to the namespace assigned to the prefix -->
    <!-- Note that because a namespace prefix is used for the <svg:svg> element and its child <svg:circle>, it wasn't necessary to redeclare the default namespace -->
    <!-- n general though it is better to redeclare the default namespace rather than prefix lots of elements in this way -->

        setAttributeNode	    setAttributeNodeNS
        setNamedItem	        setNamedItemNS

        > The first parameter for all the DOM2 namespace aware methods must be the namespace name (also known as the namespace URI) of the element or parameter in question: For SVG elements this is http://www.w3.org/2000/svg
        > However, note carefully: the Namespaces in XML 1.1 recommendation states that the namespace name for parameters without a prefix does not have a value
        > In other words, although the parameters belong to the namespace of the element, you do not use the tag's namespace name. Instead, you must use null as the namespace name for unqualified (prefixless) parameters
        > So, to create an SVG rect element using document.createElementNS(), you must write:document.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', 'rect');
        > But to retrieve the value of the xparameter on an SVG rect element, you must write: rect.getAttributeNS(null, 'x');
        > Note that this isn't the case for parameters with a namespace prefix (parameters that don't belong to the same XML dialect as the element)
        > Parameters such as xlink:href require the namespace name that was assigned to that prefix (http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink for XLink)
        > Hence to get the value of the xlink:href parameter of an <a> element in SVG you would write: elt.getAttributeNS('http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink', 'href');
        > For setting parameters that have a namespace, it is recommended (but not required) that you also include their prefix in the second parameter so that the DOM can later be more easily converted back to XML (if for instance you want to send it back to the server): elt.setAttributeNS('http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink', 'xlink:href', 'otherdoc.svg');
        > As a final example, here's a demonstration of how you should dynamically create an <image> element using script:
        var SVG_NS = 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg';
        var XLink_NS = 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink';
        var image = document.createElementNS(SVG_NS, 'image');
        image.setAttributeNS(null, 'width', '100');
        image.setAttributeNS(null, 'height', '100');
        image.setAttributeNS(XLink_NS, 'xlink:href', 'flower.png');

        > Make sure you always declare the namespaces you use in your XML files.
        > It's a good idea to use a template that includes all the commonly used namespace declarations when creating new SVG files
        > If you don't already have one, make one up starting with the following code:
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
            xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
        </svg>

        > Even if you don't use all those namespaces in a particular document, there's no harm in including the namespace declarations
        > It may save you from some annoying errors if you end up adding content from one of the unused namespaces at a later date
