    <!-- form element wraps all of the inputs a user will interact with on a form -->
    <!-- form element accepts two essential attributes; the first is the action attribute which takes a URL value that tells the form where it should send its data to be processed -->
    <!-- second is the method attribute which tells the browser which HTTP request method it should use to submit the form -->
    <!-- 
        <form action="example.com/path" method="post">

        </form>
     -->
    <!-- These are all the elements users will interact with on the form, such as text boxes, dropdowns, checkboxes and buttons -->

    <!-- input element is the most versatile of all the form control elements. It accepts a type attribute which tells the browser what type of data it should expect and how it should render the input elemen -->

    <!-- we can give our inputs a label to inform users what type of data they are expected to enter, Labels accept a for attribute, which associates it with a particular input -->
    <!-- When a label is associated with an input and is clicked, it will focus the cursor on that input, ready for the user to input some data, This helps make our forms more accessible to users who rely on assistive technologies -->

    <!-- To guide users on what to enter in form elements, we can include placeholder text in input fields -->
    <!-- Use placeholder text to demonstrate how text should be entered and formatted -->

    <!-- "name" attribute serves as a reference to the data inputted into a form control after submitting it, think of it as a variable name for the input -->
    <!-- Form input should always have a name attribute; otherwise, it will be ignored when the form is submitted -->
    <form action="http://httpbin.org/post" method="post">
      <div>
        <label for="first_name">First Name:</label>
        <!-- <input type="text" name="first_name1" id="first_name" /> -->
        <input type="text" name="first_name" id="first_name" />
      </div>

      <div>
        <label for="last_name">Last Name:</label>
        <!-- <input type="text" name="last_name1" id="last_name" /> -->
        <input type="text" name="last_name" id="last_name" />
      </div>

      <div>
        <label for="age">Age:</label>
        <input type="number" name="age" id="age" />
      </div>

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

    <!-- It’s worth mentioning that you can use any of the form controls HTML provides outside of the <form> element, even when you don’t have a backend server where you can send data -->
    <!-- For example you might want to have an input that gets some data from a user and display that somewhere else on the page with JavaScript -->
    <div>
      <label for="username">What's your name?</label>
      <input type="text" id="username" />
      <button class="greet-btn">Greet Me</button>
    </div>

    <h1 class="greeting"></h1>
    <script>
      const name = document.querySelector("#username");
      const greetMeButton = document.querySelector(".greet-btn");
      const greetingOutput = document.querySelector(".greeting");

      greetMeButton.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
        greetingOutput.innerText = `Hello ${name.value}`;
      });
    </script>

    <!-- Email inputs are specialized text inputs just for email addresses, To create an email input, we use an input element with type attribute of “email” -->
    <!-- They are different from text inputs in that they will display a different keyboard which will include the @ symbol on mobile devices to make entering email addresses easier -->

    <!-- Password inputs are another specialized text input. They differ from regular text inputs in that they mask the inputted data with asterisks(*) to prevent anyone from seeing what has been entered -->
    <!-- A password input can be created using an input element with a type of “password” -->

    <!-- The number input only accepts number values and ignores any other characters the user tries to enter -->
    <!-- We create a number input using the input element with a type attribute of “number” -->

    <!-- To collect dates from a user, we can use a date input. This input is unique because it provides a better user experience for choosing dates by rendering a simple date picker calendar -->
    <!-- To create a date input, we use the input element with a type attribute of “date” -->

    <!-- text area element provides an input box that can accept text that spans multiple lines like user comments and reviews. It can also be resized by clicking and dragging the bottom right corner to make it bigger or smaller -->
    <!-- To create a text area, we use the <textarea> element, Text area elements accept a couple of unique attributes that other form controls do not. These are the rows and cols attributes. They allow you to control the initial height(rows) and width(cols) of the text area -->

    <!-- The select element renders a dropdown list where users can select an option -->
    <!-- To create a select dropdown, we use the <select> element. Any options we want to display within the select element are defined using <option> elements -->
    <!-- All the option elements need to have a value attribute. This value will be sent to the server when the form is submitted -->
    <!-- We can set one of the options to be the default selected element when the browser first renders the form by giving one of the options the selected attribute -->
    <select name="Car">
      <option value="mercedes">Mercedes</option>
      <option value="tesla">Tesla</option>
      <option value="volvo" selected>Volvo</option>
      <option value="bmw">BMW</option>
      <option value="mini">Mini</option>
      <option value="ford">Ford</option>
    </select>
    <!-- We may also split the list of options into groups using the <optgroup> element. The optgroup element takes a label attribute which the browser uses as the label for each group -->
    <select name="fashion">
      <optgroup label="Clothing">
        <option value="t_shirt">T-Shirts</option>
        <option value="sweater">Sweaters</option>
        <option value="coats">Coats</option>
      </optgroup>
      <optgroup label="Foot Wear">
        <option value="sneakers">Sneakers</option>
        <option value="boots">Boots</option>
        <option value="sandals">Sandals</option>
      </optgroup>
    </select>

    <!-- when we have a smaller list of 5 or fewer options to choose from, it is often a better user experience to have them displayed on the page instead of hidden behind a dropdown -->
    <!-- Radio buttons allow us to create multiple options that the user can choose one of. To create radio buttons, we use the ever adaptable input element again with a type attribute of “radio” -->
    <!-- When we select one of the radio buttons and then select another, it will deselect the first one. Radio buttons know to do this because they have the same name attribute -->
    <!-- We can set the default selected radio button by adding the checked attribute to it -->
    <h1>Ticket Type</h1>
    <div>
      <input type="radio" id="child" name="ticket_type" value="child" />
      <label for="child">Child</label>
    </div>

    <div>
      <input type="radio" id="adult" name="ticket_type" value="adult" />
      <label for="adult">Adult</label>
    </div>

    <div>
      <input type="radio" id="senior" name="ticket_type" value="senior" />
      <label for="senior">Senior</label>
    </div>

    <!-- Checkboxes are similar to radio buttons in that they allow users to choose from a set of predefined options. But unlike radio buttons, they allow multiple options to be selected at once -->
    <!-- To create a checkbox, we use the input element with a type attribute of “checkbox” -->
    <h1>Pizza Toppings</h1>

    <div>
      <input type="checkbox" id="sausage" name="topping" value="sausage" />
      <label for="sausage">Sausage</label>
    </div>

    <div>
      <input type="checkbox" id="onions" name="topping" value="onions" />
      <label for="onions">Onions</label>
    </div>

    <div>
      <input type="checkbox" id="pepperoni" name="topping" value="pepperoni" />
      <label for="pepperoni">Pepperoni</label>
    </div>

    <div>
      <input type="checkbox" id="mushrooms" name="topping" value="mushrooms" />
      <label for="mushrooms">Mushrooms</label>
    </div>
    <!-- We can also have a single checkbox when we want users to toggle if they want something to be true or false. Like signing up to a newsletter when they create an account for example -->
    <!-- We can set checkboxes to be checked by default on page load by giving them a checked attribute -->
    <div>
      <input type="checkbox" id="newsletter" name="news_letter" checked />
      <label for="newsletter">Send me the news letter</label>
    </div>

    <!-- To create a button, we use the <button> element. The content or text we want to have displayed inside the button will go within the opening and closing tags -->
    <!-- The button element also accepts a type attribute that tells the browser which kind of button it is dealing with. There are three types of buttons available to us -->
    <!-- type attribute has a value of submit by default, i.e. if the type is not specified or the value provided is invalid, To create a submit button, we use the button element with a type attribute of “submit” -->
    <!-- A reset button clears all the data the user has entered into the form and sets all the inputs in the form back to what they were initially, To create a reset button, we use the button element with a type attribute of “reset” -->
    <!-- The third and final button type is simply a generic button that can be used for anything. It’s commonly used with JS for creating interactive UI’s, To create a generic button, we use the button element with a type attribute of “button” -->
    <!--  It is important to remember that a button within a form with the type value of submit (which happens to be the default value) will always try to make a new request and submit data back to the server -->
    <!-- Hence, for buttons that are used within a form for different purposes other than submitting the data, the type attribute should always be specified to avoid unwanted effects of submitting a form -->

    <!-- HTML provides a couple of elements that make it easy to organize forms into sections that are visually distinct and manageable to digest -->
    <!-- To create a fieldset, we use the <fieldset> element. Whatever form inputs we want to group together go within the opening and closing fieldset tags -->
    <fieldset>
      <label for="first_name">First Name</label>
      <input type="text" id="first_name" name="first_name" />

      <label for="last_name">Last Name</label>
      <input type="text" id="last_name" name="last_name" />
    </fieldset>

    <!-- The legend element is used to give field sets a heading or caption so the user can see what a grouping of inputs is for -->
    <!-- To create a legend, we use the <legend> element with the text we want to display within its opening and closing tags. A legend should always come right after an opening fieldset tag -->
    <fieldset>
      <legend>Contact Details</legend>

      <label for="name">Name:</label>
      <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />

      <label for="phone_number">Phone Number:</label>
      <input type="tel" id="phone_number" name="phone_number" />

      <label for="email">Email:</label>
      <input type="email" id="email" name="email" />
    </fieldset>

    <fieldset>
      <legend>Delivery Details</legend>

      <label for="street_address">Street Address:</label>
      <input type="text" id="street_address" name="street_address" />

      <label for="city">City:</label>
      <input type="text" id="city" name="city" />

      <label for="zip_code">Zip Code:</label>
      <input type="text" id="zip_code" name="zip_code" />
    </fieldset>

    <!-- A common use-case for these elements is using a fieldset to group radio buttons and using a legend to communicate to the user what each of the options is ultimately for -->
    <fieldset>
      <legend>What would you like to drink?</legend>

      <div>
        <input type="radio" name="drink" id="coffee" value="coffee" />
        <label for="coffee">Coffee</label>
      </div>

      <div>
        <input type="radio" name="drink" id="tea" value="tea" />
        <label for="tea">Tea</label>
      </div>

      <div>
        <input type="radio" name="drink" id="soda" value="soda" />
