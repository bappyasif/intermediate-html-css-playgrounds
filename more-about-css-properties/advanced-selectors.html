        Advanced selectors:

        Parent and Sibling Combinators: 
            [] > - the child combinator
                >> Unlike the descendant combinator, it will only select direct children
                >> Phrased another way, the child selector will select an element that is one level of indentation down
                >> for example:
                    >> main > div, This rule will only select divs with a class of child
                    >> main > div > div, This rule will only select divs with a class of grand-child
            [] + - the adjacent sibling combinator
                >> In order to select an element that is adjacent to our target, or on the same level of indentation, we can use the adjacent sibling combinator +
                >> for example: 
                    >> .group1 + div, This rule will only select the div with the class child group2
                    >> .group1 + div + div: This rule will only select the div with the class child group3
            [] ~ - the general sibling combinator
                >> if we want to select all of an elementâ€™s siblings and not just the first one, we can use the general sibling combinator ~
                >> for example:
                    typo >> .group1 ~ div, This rule will select all of .group1's siblings - in this case the 2nd and 3rd .child divs
            >> Just like the descendant combinator, these selectors donâ€™t have any special specificity rules - their specificity score will just be made up of their component parts

        Afvanced selectors (continued): 
        
        Pseudo-selectors: 
            >> a quick note on the difference between pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes: 
                >> Pseudo-class selectors are prefixed with a single colon and are a different way to target elements that already exist in HTML
                >> Pseudo-elements are prefixed with two colons and are used to target elements that donâ€™t normally exist in the markup
        
        Pseudo-classes:
            >> Pseudo-classes offer us different ways to target elements in our HTML
                >> Some are based on their position or structure within the HTML
                >> Others are based on the state of a particular element, or how the user is currently interacting with it
            typo >> Pseudo-classes share the same specificity as regular classes (0, 0, 1, 0). Just like regular classes, most can be chained together
                >> (0,0,1,0) above is the notation for calculating specificity
        
        Dynamic and User Action Pseudo-classes:
            >> These types of useful pseudo-classes can make your page feel much more dynamic and interactive
                >> :focus: 
                    >> applies to an element that is currently selected by the user either through selecting it with their cursor or using their keyboard
                >> :hover: 
                    >> will affect anything under the users mouse pointer
                    >> It can be used to give extra oomph to buttons and links to highlight that theyâ€™re interactable, or to trigger a drop down menu
                >> :active: 
                    >> applies to elements that are currently being clicked, and is especially useful for giving your user feedback that their action had an effect
                    >> This is a great one to give your buttons and other interactive elements more â€˜tactileâ€™ feedback
                    >> To implement your own custom styling for links, take advantage of the :link and :visited pseudo-classes
        
        Structural Pseudo-classes:
            >> Structural pseudo-classes are a powerful way to select elements based on their position within the DOM
            >> :root: 
                >> is a special class that represents the very top level of your document - the one element that has no parents
                >> Generally when working with the web, this is equivalent to the html element, but there are a few subtle differences
                >> :root is generally the place where you will place your â€˜globalâ€™ CSS rules that you want available everywhere - such as your custom properties and CSS variables, or rules such as box-sizing: border-box;
            >> :first-child and :last-child: 
                >> will match elements that are the first or last sibling
                >> :first-child is equivalent to *:first-child and same goes for :last-child, thts why we need to be more specefic to adress them directly
            >> :empty: 
                >> will match elements that have no children at all
            >> :only-child: 
                >> will match elements that donâ€™t have any siblings
            >> :nth-child: 
                >> This is a flexible pseudo-class with a few different uses
                >> example: 
                    .myList:nth-child(5) {/* Selects the 5th child of myList */}

                    .myList:nth-child(3n) { /* Selects every 3rd child of myList */}

                    .myList:nth-child(3n + 3) { /* Selects every 3rd child of myList, beginning with the 3rd */}

                    .myList:nth-child(even) {/* Selects every even child of myList */}

        Pseudo-elements: 
            >> While pseudo-classes give us an alternative way to interact with our HTML elements based on their state or structure, pseudo-elements are more abstract
            >> They allow us to affect parts of our HTML that arenâ€™t elements at all
            >> These special elements share the same specificity as regular elements (0, 0, 0, 1)
            >> There are a number of useful pseudo-elements that can be utilized in any number of creative ways
                >> ::marker allows you to customize the styling of your <li> elementsâ€™ bullets or numbers
                >> ::first-letter and ::first-line allow you to (you guessed it!) give special styling to the first letter or line of some text
                >> ::before and ::after allow us to add extra elements onto the page with CSS, instead of HTML, using it to decorate text in various ways is one common use case
                >> ::selection allows you to change the highlighting when a user selects text on the page

        Advanced selectors (continued): 

        Attribute Selectors: 
        >> Attribute selectors have the same specificity as classes and pseudo-classes (0, 0, 1, 0)
        >> some basic usage examples: 
            >> [attribute] - This general selector will select anything where the given attribute exists. Its value doesnâ€™t matter
            >> selector[attribute] - Optionally we can combine our attribute selectors with other types of selectors, such as class or element selectors
            >> [attribute="value"] - To get really specific, we can use = to match a specific attribute with a specific value
            >> examples: 
                    [src] {
                        /* This will target any element that has a src attribute. */
                    }

                    img[src] {
                        /* This will only target img elements that have a src attribute. */
                    }

                    img[src="puppy.jpg"] {
                        /* This will target img elements with a src attribute that is exactly "puppy.jpg" */
                    }
            >> If youâ€™ve ever come across regular expressions before, these attributes use a similar syntax
                examples: 
                    [attribute^="value"] - ^= Will match strings from the start.
                    [attribute$="value"] - $= Will match strings from the end.
                    [attribute*="value"] - *= The wildcard selector will match anywhere inside the string

                    more example: 
                        >> [class^='aus'] {
                            /* Classes are attributes too!
                                This will target any class that begins with 'aus':
                                class='austria'
                                class='australia'
                            */
                            }

                            [src$='.jpg'] {
                            /* This will target any src attribute that ends in '.jpg':
                            src='puppy.jpg'
                            src='kitten.jpg'
                            */
                            }

                            [for*='ill'] {
                            /* This will target any for attribute that has 'ill' anywhere inside it:
                            for="bill"
                            for="jill"
                            for="silly"
                            for="ill"
                            */

        specificty: 
        >> If the element has inline styling, that automatically1 wins (1,0,0,0 points)
        >> For each ID value, apply 0,1,0,0 points
        >> For each class value (or pseudo-class or attribute selector), apply 0,0,1,0 points
        >> For each element reference, apply 0,0,0,1 point

        Notes:
        >> universal selector (*) has no specificity value (0,0,0,0)
        >> Pseudo-elements (e.g. :first-line) get 0,0,0,1 unlike their psuedo-class brethren which get 0,0,1,0
        >> pseudo-class :not() adds no specificity by itself, only whatâ€™s inside itâ€™s parentheses
        >> !important value appended a CSS property value is an automatic win
            >> It overrides even inline styles from the markup
            >> only way an !important value can be overridden is with another !important rule declared later in the CSS and with equal or great specificity value otherwise
