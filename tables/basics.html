        >> HTML Tables allow you to create two-dimensional tables made of rows and columns
        >> You create a table with <table></table> tags and then put the elements for rows, columns, headers, or anything else that’s possible inside those table elements
     -->
    <style>
        table,
        tr,
        th {
            border: 1px solid black;
        }

        <tr>

    <!-- 
        >> A table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (tabular data)
        When should you NOT use HTML tables:
        >> smallest container inside a table is a table cell, which is created by a <td> element ('td' stands for 'table data')
        >> HTML tables should be used for tabular data — this is what they are designed for
        >> Unfortunately, a lot of people used to use HTML tables to lay out web pages, e.g. one row to contain the header, one row to contain the content columns, one row to contain the footer, etc
        >> In short, using tables for layout rather than CSS layout techniques is a bad idea. main reasons are as follows:
            >> Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users
                >> Because tables are not the right tool for layout, and the markup is more complex than with CSS layout techniques, the screenreaders' output will be confusing to their users
            >> Tables produce tag soup
                >> As mentioned above, table layouts generally involve more complex markup structures than proper layout techniques
                >> This can result in the code being harder to write, maintain, and debug
            >> Tables are not automatically responsive
                >> When you use proper layout containers (such as <header>, <section>, <article>, or <div>), their width defaults to 100% of their parent element
                >> Tables on the other hand are sized according to their content by default, so extra measures are needed to get table layout styling to effectively work across a variety of devices
        
        Some insights on Table:
        >> As you will see, the cells are not placed underneath each other, rather they are automatically aligned with each other on the same row
        >> Each <td> element creates a single cell and together they make up the first row
        >> Every cell we add makes the row grow longer
        >> To stop this row from growing and start placing subsequent cells on a second row, we need to use the <tr> element ('tr' stands for 'table row')
        
        Adding headers with <th> elements:
            >> special cells that go at the start of a row or column and define the type of data that row or column contains (as an example, see the "Person" and "Age" cells in the first example shown in this article)
            >> problem here is that, while you can kind of make out what's going on, it is not as easy to cross reference data as it could be. If the column and row headings stood out in some way, it would be much better
            >> To recognize the table headers as headers, both visually and semantically, you can use the <th> element ('th' stands for 'table header')
            >> This works in exactly the same way as a <td>, except that it denotes a header, not a normal cell

            >> HTML has a method of defining styling information for an entire column of data all in one place — the <col> and <colgroup> elements
            >> These exist because it can be a bit annoying and inefficient having to specify styling on columns — you generally have to specify your styling information on every <td> or <th> in the column, or use a complex selector such as :nth-child
            >> Styling columns like this is limited to a few properties: border, background, width, and visibility
            >> To set other properties you'll have to either style every <td> or <th> in the column, or use a complex selector such as :nth-child
            >> take for ths exmple, This isn't ideal, as we have to repeat the styling information across all three cells in the column (we'd probably have a class set on all three in a real project and specify the styling in a separate stylesheet)
