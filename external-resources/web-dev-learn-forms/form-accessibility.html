    <!-- This attribute enables screen readers to invoke the correct pronunciation, and helps browsers offer a translation of the page if the defined language is not the default browser language -->

    <!-- Security and privacy -->
    <!-- A secure form means that all data is encrypted, kept secure, and no unauthorized access can happen -->
    <!-- To ensure privacy, only save the data you need, only save personal data after consent, ensure the user is in full control of their data, and never share user data with others without the user's consent -->

    <!-- Ensure your form is secure -->
    <!-- As a first step, make sure to request as little data as possible. Don't ask for data you don't need, and always question whether you need all of the requested data -->
    <!-- Less data means less risk, less cost, and less liability. In addition, reducing the number of fields in a form makes it less complex, easier to fill out, and can reduce abandonment rates -->
    <!-- Always use HTTPS, especially for pages that include a form. With HTTPS, data is encrypted when coming from the server and when going back to the server -->

    <!-- Help users to keep their data private -->
    <!-- If you submit a form that uses a GET request, the browser adds the request URL including form data to your browsing history.  -->
    <!-- convenient but not great at all, if sensitive data is submitted, and everybody with access to your browser history or local network can see this information -->
    <!-- Use POST requests for every form where data that's personal or otherwise sensitive may be submitted. This way, the data is only visible to the backend script processing it -->

    <!-- Ensure users can safely sign up and sign in -->
    <!-- User account authentication is a complex issue in terms of privacy and security. It may be better to use a third-party identity provider, instead of building your own secure authentication system. -->

    <!-- Help users access their personal data -->
    <!-- Make sure your users know how you plan to process personal data. Transparency is the key to trust. -->
    <!-- Users should always be able to access, modify, and delete all data you saved for them -->

    <!-- Ensure users can update their personal data -->
    <!-- Make it easy for users to update their personal data, including passwords, email addresses, and usernames. Notify users about changes to their stored personal data, and ensure users can revoke changes. -->
    <!-- Separate the concept of user account and user identity to simplify implementing third-party identity provision. Allow users to change their username and link multiple identities to a single user account -->
    <!-- Make it easy for users to delete their account, including all associated data, and where relevant, make it possible to download data -->
    <!-- Link to your privacy policy on each page with a form, especially if personal data is processed -->
    <!-- Require an additional authentication step, for example, re-entering the current password, to view or change personal information on your site -->

    <!-- Ensure all data is in good shape -->
    <!-- Frontend validation is important, but users might still be able to submit invalid data. As a next step, you must also validate the data on the backend before saving the data in your database -->
    <!-- Validation helps to ensure that the data format is valid, but you should still not trust data entered by users. How can you safely output the data? To prevent Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and ensure all data is safe to include in HTML, you must sanitize data before output -->

    <!-- Ensure all submissions come from real people -->
    <!-- The first option is to use a service such as reCAPTCHA, to distinguish between real people and bots -->
    <!-- Always make sure your spam protections are accessible. Try them out by using a screen reader, and by only using your keyboard. The best spam protection is useless if it makes the form unusable for real people -->

    <!-- A honeypot -->
    <!-- Another option is to use a so-called 'honeypot': a visually hidden form field. Humans won't see a honeypot field, but bots will fill it in.  -->
    <!-- On the backend, your processing script can check if the field was completed. If it was, the submission was probably from a bot, and you can ignore it -->
    <!-- Make sure to hide a honeypot field for screen readers, by using the aria-hidden="true" attribute -->
    <!-- There are also services like Akismet, which can help you with spam protection. The Akismet filter works by combining information about spam captured on all participating sites, and then using those spam rules to block future spam. Akismet is transparent to the user, and catches most spam -->
