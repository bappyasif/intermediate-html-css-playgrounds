        Absolute vs Relative Units: 

        Absoloute Units: 
            >> Absolute units are those that are always the same in any context
            >> px is an absolute unit because the size of a pixel doesn’t change relative to anything else on the page
            >> In fact, px is the only absolute unit you should be using for web projects
            >> rest of them make more sense in a print setting because they are related to physical units such as in (inch) and cm (centimeter)
        
        Relative Units: 
            >> Relative units are units that can change based on their context
            >> em and rem: but as a rule-of-thumb, prefer rem
                >> 1em is the font-size of an element (or the element’s parent if you’re using it to set font-size), 
                    >> for example, if an element’s font-size is 16px, then setting its width to 4em would make its width 64px (16 * 4 == 64)
                >> 1rem is the font-size of the root element (either :root or html)
                    >> math works the same with rem as it did with em, but without the added complexity of keeping track of the parent’s font size
                    >> Relying on em could mean that a particular size could change if the context changes, which is very likely not the behavior you want
                    >> Using a relative size like rem to define font sizes across your website is recommended
        
        Viewport Units:
            >> units vh and vw relate to the size of the viewport
            >> Specifically, 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height and 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width
            >> These can be useful any time you want something to be sized relative to the viewport, examples including full-height heroes, full-screen app-like interfaces

         Numbers, lengths, and percentages:
            >> integer: An <integer> is a whole number such as 1024 or -55
            >> number: A <number> represents a decimal number — it may or may not have a decimal point with a fractional component (e.g. 0.255, 128, or -1.2)
            >> dimension: 
                >> A <dimension> is a <number> with a unit attached to it. For example, 45deg, 5s, or 10px
                >> <dimension> is an umbrella category that includes the <length>, <angle>, <time>, and <resolution> types
            >> percentage: 
                >> A <percentage> represents a fraction of some other value. For example, 50%
                >> Percentage values are always relative to another quantity
                >> For example, an element's length is relative to its parent element's length
            >> Lengths: 
                >> numeric type you will come across most frequently is <length>, For example 10px (pixels) or 30em
                >> There are two types of lengths used in CSS — relative and absolute
                >>  It's important to know the difference in order to understand how big or small things will become

                >> Absolute length units: Most of these units are more useful when used for print, rather than screen output:
                    >> Centimeters, cm
                    >> Millimeters, mm
                    >> Quarter-millimeters, Q
                    >> inches, in
                    >> Picas, pc
                    >> Points, pt
                    >> Pixels, px (mostly used for web-projects)
                
                >> Relative length units:
                    >> Relative length units are relative to something else, perhaps the size of the parent element's font, or the size of the viewport
                    >> Some of the most useful units for web development are listed below:
                    >> em
                        >> Font size of the parent, in the case of typographical properties like font-size, and font size of the element itself, in the case of other properties like width
                    >> ex
                        >> x-height of the element's font
                    >> ch
                        >> advance measure (width) of the glyph "0" of the element's font
                    >> rem
                        >> Font size of the root element
                    >> lh
                        >> line height of element
                    >> vw
                        >> 1% of the viewport's width
                    >> vh
                        >> 1% of the viewport's height
                    >> vmin:
                        >> 1% of the viewport's smaller dimension
                    >> vmax
                        >> 1% of the viewport's larger dimension
                
                >> ems and rems: mostly frequently encountered units: 
                    >> To recap, the em unit means "my parent element's font-size" in the case of typography
                    >> To recap, the rem unit means "The root element's font-size". (rem stands for "root em".)
                
                >> Percentages: 
                    >> In a lot of cases, a percentage is treated in the same way as a length
                    >> thing with percentages is that they are always set relative to some other value
                    >> For example: 
                        >> if you set an element's font-size as a percentage, it will be a percentage of the font-size of the element's parent
                        >> If you use a percentage for a width value, it will be a percentage of the width of the parent
                    >> Note that, while many value types accept a length or a percentage, there are some that only accept length
                    >> If the allowed value includes <length-percentage> then you can use a length or a percentage. If the allowed value only includes <length>, it is not possible to use a percentage
                    
                >> Numbers: 
                    >> Some value types accept numbers, without any unit added to them
                    >> An example of a property which accepts a unitless number is the opacity property, which controls the opacity of an element (how transparent it is)

                >> Color: 
                    >> standard color system available in modern computers supports 24-bit colors, which allows the display of about 16.7 million distinct colors via a combination of different red, green and blue channels with 256 different values per channel (256 x 256 x 256 = 16,777,216.)
                    >> Color keywords: 
                        >> There are a number of these keywords, some of which have fairly entertaining names! You can see a full list on the page for the <color> value type
                    >> Hexadecimal RGB values: 
                        >> Each hex value consists of a hash/pound symbol (#) followed by six hexadecimal numbers, each of which can take one of 16 values between 0 and f (which represents 15) — so 0123456789abcdef
                        >> Each pair of values represents one of the channels — red, green and blue — and allows us to specify any of the 256 available values for each (16 x 16 = 256.)
                        >> These values are a bit more complex and less easy to understand, but they are a lot more versatile than keywords — you can use hex values to represent any color you want to use in your color scheme
                    >> RGB and RGBA values: 
                        >> An RGB value is a function — rgb() — which is given three parameters that represent the red, green, and blue channel values of the colors, in much the same way as hex values
                        >> difference with RGB is that each channel is represented not by two hex digits, but by a decimal number between 0 and 255 — somewhat easier to understand
                        >> You can also use RGBA colors — these work in exactly the same way as RGB colors, and so you can use any RGB values
                        >> However, there is a fourth value that represents the alpha channel of the color, which controls opacity, Values in between 0 and 1 give you different levels of transparency
                        >> When you use opacity you make the element and everything inside it opaque, whereas using RGBA colors only makes the color you are specifying opaque
                        >> both rgba() and rgb() accept colors with and without alpha channel values
                        >> but separating out non-transparent and transparent color definitions to use the different functions gives (very) slightly better browser support and can act as a visual indicator of where transparent colors are being defined in your code
                    >> HSL and HSLA values:
                        >> Instead of red, green, and blue values, the hsl() function accepts hue, saturation, and lightness values, which are used to distinguish between the 16.7 million colors, but in a different way:
                            >> Hue: 
                                >> base shade of the color
                                >> This takes a value between 0 and 360, representing the angles around a color wheel
                            >> Saturation: 
                                >> This takes a value from 0–100%
                                >> where 0 is no color (it will appear as a shade of grey), and 100% is full color saturation
                            >> Lightness: 
                                >> This takes a value from 0–100%
                                >> where 0 is no light (it will appear completely black) and 100% is full light (it will appear completely white)
                        >> Just as RGB has RGBA, HSL has an HSLA equivalent, which gives you the same ability to specify the alpha channel
                    >> You can mix and match color models, however for consistency it is usually best if your entire project uses the same one!
                
                >> Images: 
                    >> <image> value type is used wherever an image is a valid value
                    >> This can be an actual image file pointed to via a url() function, or a gradient
                    typo >> there (There) are some other possible values for <image>, however these are newer and currently have poor browser support
                
                >> Position: 
                    >> <position> value type represents a set of 2D coordinates, used to position an item such as a background image (via background-position)
                    >> It can take keywords such as top, left, bottom, right, and center to align items with specific bounds of a 2D box, along with lengths, which represent offsets from the top and left-hand edges of the box
                    >> A typical position value consists of two values — the first sets the position horizontally, the second vertically
                    >> If you only specify values for one axis the other will default to center
                
                >> Strings and identifiers: 
                    >> we've seen places where keywords are used as a value (for example <color> keywords like red, black, rebeccapurple, and goldenrod)
                    >> These keywords are more accurately described as identifiers, a special value that CSS understands
                    >> As such they are not quoted — they are not treated as strings
                    >> There are places where you use strings in CSS
                    typo >> For example(,) when specifying generated content, when used with content prop in a css rule

                >> Functions: 
                    >> In programming, a function is a reusable section of code that can be run multiple times to complete a repetitive task with minimum effort on the part of both the developer and the computer
                    >> Functions are usually associated with languages like JavaScript, Python, or C++, but they do exist in CSS too, as property values
                    >> We've already seen functions in action in the Colors section — rgb(), hsl(), etc
                    >> value used to return an image from a file — url() — is also a function
                    >> A value that behaves more like something you might find in a traditional programming language is the calc() CSS function
                        >> This function gives you the ability to do simple calculations inside your CSS
                        >> It's particularly useful if you want to work out values that you can't define when writing the CSS for your project, and need the browser to work out for you at runtime
