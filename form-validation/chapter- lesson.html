    <title>Form Validation</title>

<body>
    <!-- Validations allow us to set specific constraints or rules that determine what data users can enter into an input -->
    <!-- When a user enters data that breaks the rules, a message will appear, providing feedback on what was wrong with the entered data and how to fix it -->

    <!-- Required Validation -->
    <!-- To make a field required, we simply add the required attribute to it -->
    <!-- To ensure a good user experience and to meet accessibility guidelines, we should always indicate which fields are required -->
    <!-- his will often be done by adding an asterisk(*) to the required field label -->

    <!-- Text Length Validations -->
    <!-- Sometimes we will want users to enter a minimum or a maximum amount of text into a field -->

    <!-- Minimum Length Validation -->
    <!-- To add the minimum length validation, we give the form control a minlength attribute with an integer value that represents the minimum amount of characters we want to allow in the form control -->

    <!-- Maximum Length Validation -->
    <!-- To add a maximum length validation, we give the form control a maxlength attribute with an integer value which represents the maximum amount of characters we want to allow in the form control -->

    <!-- Combining Validations -->
    <!-- HTML allows us to apply as many validations as we wish to a form control, HTML allows us to apply as many validations as we wish to a form control -->

    <!-- Number Range Validations -->
    <!-- min and max attributes only work with number-based form controls such as the number, dates and time inputs -->

    <!-- Min Validation -->
    <!-- To add a minimum value validation, we give the form control a min attribute with an integer value which represents the minimum number we want the form control to accept -->

    <!-- Min Validation -->
    <!-- To add a maximum value validation, we give the form control a max attribute with an integer value which represents the maximum number we want the form control to accept -->

    <!-- Pattern Validations -->
    <!-- To ensure we get the correct information from users, we will often want to ensure data matches a particular pattern -->
    <!-- To add a pattern validation, we give the form control a pattern attribute with a regular expression as the value -->
    <!-- We can add a more descriptive validation message by giving our input a title attribute -->
    <!-- It is also good practice to use a placeholder attribute to show users an example of the expected pattern they need to enter -->
    <!-- The pattern attribute can only be used on <input> elements. Some input elements already validate data that matches a certain pattern -->
    <!-- For example the email input field which will make sure a valid email is entered and the url input element which will check to ensure the url starts with http or https -->


    <form action="#" method="get">

    <!-- Styling Validations -->
    <!-- We can target form controls that have passed or failed validations using the :valid and :invalid pseudo-classes -->
    <style>
        input {
            border: 2px solid #000;

    <!-- conclusion -->
    <!-- The built-in validations will take you far with ensuring your users enter the correct data. They are quick and easy to add. However, they have their limitations -->
    <!-- we will need to get creative and make custom validations using JavaScript and CSS -->
    <!-- Itâ€™s also worth noting client-side validations are not a silver bullet for ensuring users enter the correct data. To ensure the integrity of any user data coming into our systems, we should also have server-side validations in place -->
