<body>
    <!-- Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is called client-side form validation, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls. -->
    <!-- Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away -->
    <!-- client-side validation should not be considered an exhaustive security measure! Your apps should always perform security checks on any form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the client-side, because client-side validation is too easy to bypass, so malicious users can still easily send bad data through to your server -->

    <!-- What is form validation? -->
    <!-- When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application -->
    <!-- Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation -->
    <!-- If the information is correctly formatted, the application allows the data to be submitted to the server and (usually) saved in a database; if the information isn't correctly formatted, it gives the user an error message explaining what needs to be corrected, and lets them try again -->
    <!-- Never trust data passed to your server from the client. Even if your form is validating correctly and preventing malformed input on the client-side, a malicious user can still alter the network request -->

    <!-- 
        Different types of client-side validation: 
            > Built-in form validation: uses HTML5 form validation features, but it is not as customizable as js validation
            > Javascript vcalidation: is coded using JavaScript, is completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library)

        Using built-in form validation:
            > required, min/maxlength, min/max, type, pattern
            > If the data entered in a form field follows all of the rules specified by the above attributes, it is considered valid. If not, it is considered invalid
        
        When an element is valid, the following things are true:
            > element matches the :valid CSS pseudo-class, which lets you apply a specific style to valid elements
            > If the user tries to send the data, the browser will submit the form, provided there is nothing else stopping it from doing so (e.g., JavaScript)

        When an element is invalid, the following things are true: 
            > element matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-class, and sometimes other UI pseudo-classes (e.g., :out-of-range) depending on the error, which lets you apply a specific style to invalid elements
            > If the user tries to send the data, the browser will block the form and display an error message
    -->

    <!-- Built-in form validation examples -->
    <!-- simplest HTML5 validation feature is the required attribute, o make an input mandatory, add this attribute to the element -->
    <!-- When this attribute is set, the element matches the :required UI pseudo-class and the form won't submit, displaying an error message on submission when the input is empty -->
    <!-- The presence of the required attribute on any element that supports this attribute means the element matches the :required pseudoclass whether it has a value or not -->
    <!-- For good user experience, indicate to the user when form fields are required. It isn't only good user experience, it is required by WCAG accessibility guidelines -->

    <!-- Validating against a regular expression -->
    <!-- pattern attribute expects a Regular Expression as its value, , so regexps are ideal for form validation and serve a variety of other uses in JavaScript -->
    <!-- regular expressions are case-sensitive, but we've made it support capitalized as well as lower-case versions using an extra "Aa" pattern nested inside square brackets -->
    <!-- If a non-empty value of the <input> doesn't match the regular expression's pattern, the input will match the :invalid pseudoclass -->
    <!-- <textarea> element doesn't support the pattern attribute -->

    <!-- For number fields (i.e. <input type="number">), the min and max attributes can be used to provide a range of valid values. If the field contains a value outside this range, it will be invalid. -->
    <!-- <input type="number"> (and other types, such as range and date) can also take a step attribute, which specifies what increment the value will go up or down by when the input controls are used (such as the up and down number buttons) -->

    <!-- Validating forms using JavaScript -->
    <!-- You must use JavaScript if you want to take control over the look and feel of native error messages or to deal with legacy browsers that do not support HTML's built-in form validation -->

    <!-- 
        The Constraint Validation API: 
        > constraint validations work on these html elements: button, fieldset, input, output, select, textarea

        The Constraint validation API makes the following properties available on the above elements:
        > validation message:
            > Returns a localized message describing the validation constraints that the control doesn't satisfy (if any)
            > If the control is not a candidate for constraint validatio or the element's value satisfies its constraints (is valid), this will return an empty string
        > validity: 
            > the element's value satisfies its constraints (is valid), this will return an empty string
            > some of its properties common use cases are: patternMismatch, tooLong, tooShort, rangeOverflow, rangeUnderflow, typeMismatch, valid, valueMissing
        > willValidate:
            > Returns true if the element will be validated when the form is submitted; false otherwise
        
        Consgtraint validationapoi also makes available these following methods on candidate elements and form element:
        > checkValidity(): 
            > Returns true if the element's value has no validity problems; false otherwise
            > f the element is invalid, this method also fires an invalid event on the element
        > reportValidity(): 
            > Reports invalid field(s) using events
            > Useful in combination with preventDefault() in an onSubmit event handler
        > setCustomValidity(message): 
            > Adds a custom error message to the element; if you set a custom error message, the element is considered to be invalid, and the specified error is displayed
            > This lets you use JavaScript code to establish a validation failure other than those offered by the standard HTML5 validation constraints
        
        > Implementing a customized error message: html validation has these limitations:
            > There is no standard way to change their look and feel with CSS
            > They depend on the browser locale, which means that you can have a page in one language but an error message displayed in another language
    -->
    <!-- Here we store a reference to the email input, then add an event listener to it that runs the contained code each time the value inside the input is changed -->
    <!-- if type missmatches then we call the setCustomValidity() method with a custom message which is displayed by calling reportValidity() -->
    <!-- this renders the input invalid, so that when you try to submit the form, submission fails and the custom error message is displayed -->
    <!-- If the validity.typeMismatch property returns false, we call the setCustomValidity() method an empty string. This renders the input valid, so the form will submit -->
