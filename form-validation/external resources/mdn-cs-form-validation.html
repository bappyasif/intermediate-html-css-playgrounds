    <title>Client side form validation</title>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is called client-side form validation, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls. -->
    <!-- Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away -->
    <!-- client-side validation should not be considered an exhaustive security measure! Your apps should always perform security checks on any form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the client-side, because client-side validation is too easy to bypass, so malicious users can still easily send bad data through to your server -->

    <!-- What is form validation? -->
    <!-- When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application -->
    <!-- Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation -->
    <!-- If the information is correctly formatted, the application allows the data to be submitted to the server and (usually) saved in a database; if the information isn't correctly formatted, it gives the user an error message explaining what needs to be corrected, and lets them try again -->
    <!-- Never trust data passed to your server from the client. Even if your form is validating correctly and preventing malformed input on the client-side, a malicious user can still alter the network request -->

    <!-- 
        Different types of client-side validation: 
            > Built-in form validation: uses HTML5 form validation features, but it is not as customizable as js validation
            > Javascript vcalidation: is coded using JavaScript, is completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library)

        Using built-in form validation:
            > required, min/maxlength, min/max, type, pattern
            > If the data entered in a form field follows all of the rules specified by the above attributes, it is considered valid. If not, it is considered invalid
        
        When an element is valid, the following things are true:
            > element matches the :valid CSS pseudo-class, which lets you apply a specific style to valid elements
            > If the user tries to send the data, the browser will submit the form, provided there is nothing else stopping it from doing so (e.g., JavaScript)

        When an element is invalid, the following things are true: 
            > element matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-class, and sometimes other UI pseudo-classes (e.g., :out-of-range) depending on the error, which lets you apply a specific style to invalid elements
            > If the user tries to send the data, the browser will block the form and display an error message
    -->

    <!-- Built-in form validation examples -->
    <!-- simplest HTML5 validation feature is the required attribute, o make an input mandatory, add this attribute to the element -->
    <!-- When this attribute is set, the element matches the :required UI pseudo-class and the form won't submit, displaying an error message on submission when the input is empty -->
    <!-- The presence of the required attribute on any element that supports this attribute means the element matches the :required pseudoclass whether it has a value or not -->
    <!-- For good user experience, indicate to the user when form fields are required. It isn't only good user experience, it is required by WCAG accessibility guidelines -->
