        What the Grid?
        >> Grid is often praised for easy placement of items in a two-dimensional layout
        >> But Grid can be used for one-dimensional layouts too
        >> One advantage for developers is if they start off with only one row of items, they can simply add additional rows later
        >> a lot of similarities between Flex and Grid
            >> Both use parent containers with child items
            >> They have similar property names for alignment and positioning
        >> One of the big highlights for CSS Grid was the use of the gap property
            >> This used to only be available to Grid, but is now supported with Flex too
        >> not only do each of these modules have their own use cases, but you will also find it helpful to pair Flex and Grid together
     -->

    <!-- 
        differences between flexbox and grid layout: 
        >> Flexbox can optionally wrap
            >> If we allow a flex container to wrap, they will wrap down onto another row when the flex items fill a row
            >> Where they line up on the next row is independent of what happenned on the first row, allowing for a masonry-like look

            >> Grid can also optionally wrap (if we allow auto filling) in the sense that items can fill a row and move to the new row (or auto place themselves)
            >> but as they do, they will fall along the same grid lines all the other elements do
        
        >> You could think of flexbox as “one dimensional”
            >> While flexbox can make rows and columns in the sense that it allows elements to wrap
            >> there’s no way to declaratively control where elements end up since the elements merely push along a single axis and then wrap or not wrap accordingly
            >> and it’s because of that single dimension that we can optionally do things, like align elements along a baseline 
            >> which is something grid is unable to do

        >> You could think of grid as “two dimensional“
            >> we can (if we want to) declare the sizing of rows and columns and then explicitly place things into both rows and columns as we choose
        
        >> Grid is mostly defined on the parent element
            >> In flexbox, most of the layout (beyond the very basics) happen on the children
        
        >> Grid is better at overlapping
            >> Getting elements to overlap in flexbox requires looking at traditional stuff, like negative margins, transforms, or absolute positioning in order to break out of the flex behavior
            >> With grid, we can place items on overlapping grid lines, or even right within the same exact grid cells

        >> Grid is sturdier
            >> While the flexing of flexbox is sometimes its strength, the way a flex item is sized gets rather complicated
                >> It’s a combination of width, min-width, max-width, flex-basis, flex-grow, and flex-shrink, not to mention the content inside and things like white-space, as well as the other items in the same row
            >> Grid has interesting space-occupying features, like fractional units, and the ability for content to break grids, 
                >> though, generally speaking, we’re setting up grid lines and placing items within them that plop right into place
            
        >> Flexbox can push things away
            >> It’s a rather unique feature of flexbox that you can, for example, put margin-right: auto; on an element 
            >> and, if there is room, that element will push everything else as far away as it can go can

          Grid

          >> We can think about CSS Grid in terms of a container and items
          >> Simply put, when you make an element a grid container, it will “contain” the whole grid
          >> In CSS, an element is turned into a grid container with the property display: grid or display: inline-grid
          >> What’s easy about CSS Grid is that you don’t have to assign each child element a property
          >> Note that only the direct child elements will become grid items
          >> If we had another element as a child under one of these child elements it would not be a grid item
          >> grid items can also be grid containers

          Lines and Tracks in Grids

          >> A lot of resources on CSS Grid like to show you boxes and outlined grid tables right from the start
          >> But if your grid container and grid items don’t have any borders you won’t actually see these lines on the page

          Columns and Rows

          >> to specefy columns and rows will define the grid track (the space between lines on a grid)
          >> grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows make defining column and row tracks easy
          >> we could set a column track to give us space between our columns and a row track to give us space between our rows
          >> columns and rows can have px, percentage and franctional units too
          >> CSS Grid also includes a shorthand property for defining rows and columns
            >> we can replace the properties for grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns with the shorthand grid-template property
            >> e.g. grid-template: 50px 50px / 50px 50px 50px; 
            >> rows are defined before the slash and columns are defined after the slash
          
          Explicit vs Implicit Grid

          >> implicit grid concept it's how CSS Grid is able to automatically place grid items when we haven’t explicitly defined the layout for them
          >> When we use the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties, we are explicitly defining grid tracks to lay out our grid items
          >> But when the grid needs more tracks for extra content, it will implicitly define new grid tracks
          >> Additionally, the size values established from our grid-template-columns or grid-template-rows properties are not carried over into these implicit grid tracks
            >> But we can define values for the implicit grid tracks
          >> We can set the implicit grid track sizes using the grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns properties
            >> In this way we can ensure any new tracks the implicit grid makes for extra content are set at values that we defined
          >> By default, CSS Grid will add additional content with implicit rows
            >> This means the extra elements would keep being added further down the grid in a vertical fashion.
          >> It would be much less common to want extra content added horizontally along the grid, but that can be set using the grid-auto-flow: column property and those implicit track sizes can be defined with the grid-auto-columns property

          Gap

          >> gap between grid rows and columns is known as the gutter or alley
          >> Gap sizes can be adjusted separately for rows and columns using the column-gap and row-gap properties
          >> Furthermore, we can use a shorthand property called gap to set both row-gap and column-gap
