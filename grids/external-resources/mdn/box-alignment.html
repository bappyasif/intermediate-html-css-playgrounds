    <!-- 
        >> You will see many similarities in how these properties and values work in flexbox
        >> Due to grid being two-dimensional and flexbox one-dimensional there are some small differences that you should watch out for
        >> So we will start by looking at the two axes that we deal with when aligning things in a grid
        
        The two axes of a grid layout: 
        >> When working with grid layout you have two axes available to align things against â€“ the block axis and the inline axis
        >> block axis is the axis upon which blocks are laid out in block layout
        >> inline axis runs across the block axis, it is the direction in which text in regular inline flow runs
        >> We are able to align the content inside grid areas, and the grid tracks themselves on these two axes
        

        Aligning items on the Block Axis:
        >> align-self and align-items properties control alignment on the block axis
        >> When we use these properties, we are changing the alignment of the item within the grid area you have placed it
        
        >> Using align-items: 
            >> we can use the align-items property on the grid container, to align the items using one of the following values:
                >> auto
                >> normal
                >> start
                >> end
                >> center
                >> stretch
                >> baseline
                >> first baseline
                >> last baseline
        >> Keep in mind that once you set align-items: start, the height of each child <div> will be determined by the contents of the <div>                
            >> This is in contrast to omitting align-items completely, in which case the height of each <div> stretches to fill its grid area
        >> align-items property sets the align-self property for all of the child grid items
            >> This means that you can set the property individually, by using align-self on a grid item
        
        >> using align-self: 
            >> In this next example, align-self property, to demonstrate the different alignment values: 
                >> first area, is showing the default behavior of align-self, which is to stretch
                >> second item, has an align-self value of start, the third end and the fourth center

        >> Items with an intrinsic aspect ratio: 
            >> default behavior in align-self is to stretch
                >> except for items which have an intrinsic aspect ratio, in this case they behave as start
            >> reason for this, is that if items with an aspect ratio are set to stretch, this default would distort them
                >> you can ensure that items do not stretch, such as images, which are direct children of the grid, by setting align-self and justify-self to start
                >> This will mimic the correct behavior once implemented
