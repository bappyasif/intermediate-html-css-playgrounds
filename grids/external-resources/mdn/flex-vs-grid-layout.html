    <!-- 
        >> CSS Grid Layout has been designed to work alongside other parts of CSS, as part of a complete system for doing the layout

        Grid and flexbox: 
        >> basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column
        >> Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time
        
        One-dimensional versus two-dimensional layout: 
        >> A simple question to ask yourself when deciding between grid or flexbox is: 
            >> do I only need to control the layout by row or column – use a flexbox
            >> do I need to control the layout by row and column – use a grid
        
        Content out or layout in?
        >> Flexbox works from the content out
            >> An ideal use case for flexbox is when you have a set of items and want to space them out evenly in a container
            >> You let the size of the content decide how much individual space each item takes up
            >> If the items wrap onto a new line, they will work out their spacing based on their size and the available space on that line
        >> Grid works from the layout in
            >> When you use CSS Grid Layout you create a layout and then you place items into it
            >> or you allow the auto-placement rules to place the items into the grid cells according to that strict grid
            >> It is possible to create tracks that respond to the size of the content, however, they will also change the entire track
        >> If you are using flexbox and find yourself disabling some of the flexibility, you probably need to use CSS Grid Layout
            >> An example would be if you are setting a percentage width on a flex item to make it line up with other items in a row above
            >> In that case, a grid is likely to be a better choice
        
        Box alignment: 
        >> they can be used in other specifications, including Grid Layout not just limited to flexbox layout anymore
        >> In the case of a grid layout, we are aligning the items inside their grid area, by 'start / end / etc.'

        fr unit and flex-basis: 
        >> fr unit works to assign a proportion of available space in the grid container to our grid tracks
        >> fr unit, when combined with the minmax() function can give us very similar behavior to the flex properties in flexbox while still enabling the creation of a layout in two dimensions
        >> if we drag our window wider and smaller, the flexbox does a nice job of adjusting the number of items in each row according to the available space
        >> In comparison, the grid version always has explicitly defined column tracks
            >> tracks themselves will grow and shrink, but there are always same amount of columns since we asked for three when defining our grid
        
        Auto-filling grid tracks: 
        >> We can use grid to create a similar effect to flexbox, while still keeping the content arranged in strict rows and columns, by creating our track listing using repeat notation and the auto-fill and auto-fit properties

        A flexible number of tracks:
        >> grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
        >> Once the browser has worked out how many times 200 pixels will fit into the container–also taking account of grid gaps–it will treat the 1fr maximum as an instruction to share out the remaining space between the items


        Grid and absolutely positioned elements
        >> Grid interacts with absolutely positioned elements, which can be useful if you want to position an item inside a grid or grid area
        >> specification defines the behavior when a grid container is a containing block and a parent of the absolutely positioned item

        A grid container as containing block:
        >> To make the grid container a containing block you need to add the position property to the container with a value of relative, just as you would make a containing block for any other absolutely positioned items
        >> Once you have done this, if you give a grid item position: absolute it will take as its containing block the grid container or, if the item also has a grid position, the area of the grid it is placed into
        >> You can see that the item is taking the area from grid column line 2 to 4, and starting after line 1
        >> If we remove position: absolute from the rules for .box3 you can see how it would display without the positioning

        A grid container as parent: 
        >> If the absolutely positioned child has a grid container as a parent but that container does not create a new positioning context, then it is taken out of flow as in this example
        >> positioning context will be whatever element creates a positioning context as is common to other layout methods

        With a grid area as the parent: 
        >> If the absolutely positioned item is nested inside a grid area then you can create a positioning context on that area

        Grid and display: contents
        >> An interaction with another layout specification that is worth noting is the interaction between CSS Grid Layout and display: contents
        >> contents value of the display property is a new value that is described in the Display specification as follows:
            >> element itself does not generate any boxes, but its children and pseudo-elements still generate boxes as normal
            >> For the purposes of box generation and layout, the element must be treated as if it had been replaced with its children and pseudo-elements in the document tree
        typo >> If you set an item to display: contents the box it would normally create, disappears and the boxes of the child elements appear as if they have risen up a level
            >> This means that children of a grid item can become grid items
        
        Grid layout with nested child elements:
        >> in this following markup, first item contains three span elements
        >> As these items are not direct children, they don't become part of the grid layout and so display using regular block layout
        >> This can be a way to get items nested into the grid to act as if they are part of the grid, and is a way around some of the issues that would be solved by subgrids once they are implemented
        >> You can also use display: contents in a similar way with flexbox to enable nested items to become flex items
